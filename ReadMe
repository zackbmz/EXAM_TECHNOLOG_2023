Getting started with the app

This repository contains an API server written in Python that uses MongoDB as a database. The API allows clients to create stores and add or delete musics to those stores. To get started with the app, you will need to have Docker and docker-compose installed on your system.
Installing Docker and docker-compose

You can download Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started. Once you have Docker installed, you can install docker-compose by following the instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.
Starting the app

To start the app, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Jofresh/PARTIEL-M1MIAI.git

    Change into the cloned directory:

cd EXAM_TECHNOLOG_2023/

    Run the following command to start the app:

docker-compose up -d --build

    Visit http://localhost:8763/docs once the containers are up and running. You can use tools like Postman or cURL to send requests to the API endpoints.

Stopping the app

To stop the app, run the following command:

docker-compose down

This will stop and remove the Docker containers that were created when the app was started.
